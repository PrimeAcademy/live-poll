# LivePoll

Solo Project 2021
by Edan Schwartz, FSE Instructor

## Overview

As an instructor, it is often difficult to gauge how well students are understanding the material you are presenting. This is an even greater challenge when presenting remotely.

The LivePoll app allows instructors to gather instant feedback from students during lectures, and view a live data stream of their reactions. Instructors will provide students with a “session code”, which allows the students to login to a specific session from their phone. From there, students will have a simple “slider” interface to indicate their reactions to the content, in the form of a 1-5 score. Instructors will be able to see anonymized data from the students via a web dashboard.
